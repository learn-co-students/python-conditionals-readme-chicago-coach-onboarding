    "We have been learning about different ways to use Python to interact with and manipulate data. However, we havent yet had a way to dynamically manipulate data or perform actions. For example, if a restaurant is too expensive we may want to choose a different one. If it's too cold outside, we should find something to do inside. These are just simple examples of decisions we might want our code to make as well. In this lab, we will introduce conditionals that allow us to do just that. We can use some pieces of data to inform decisions and choose one operation over any number of others."
